    abstract = {We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers. Using the N 2 molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to compute the energy with cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets, the latter having an FCI space of over 10 15 with very modest computational resources.},

Here, we reliably estimate the vertical excitations of ethene and butadiene by performing FCIQMC calculations for spaces as large as 1018 and 1029 Slater determinants, respectively. For ethene, we obtain a vertical excitation energy in the range 7.89–7.96 eV, depending on the particular equilibrium ground-state geometry employed, and definitely higher than the absorption maximum located at 7.66 eV.

We further demonstrate the benefit for calculation of reduced density matrices in FCIQMC through replica sampling, where the semi-stochastic adaptation seems to have even larger efficiency gains.

    abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods--a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O(2), CH(4), and NaH--with FCI spaces ranging from 10(9) to 10(14), whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

It has been shown to calculate the exact basis-set ground state energy of small molecules, to within modest stochastic error bars, using tractable computational cost. Here, we use this technique to elucidate an often troublesome series of first-row diatomics consisting of Be2, C2, CN, CO, N2, NO, O2, and F2. Using i-FCIQMC, the dissociation energies of these molecules are obtained almost entirely to within chemical accuracy of experimental results. Furthermore, the i-FCIQMC calculations are performed in a relatively black-box manner, without any a priori knowledge or specification of the wave function. The size consistency of i-FCIQMC is also demonstrated with regards to these diatomics at their more multiconfigurational stretched geometries. The clear and simple i-FCIQMC wave functions obtained for these systems are then compared and investigated to demonstrate the dynamic identification of the dominant determinants contributing to significant static correlation. The appearance and nature of such determinants is shown to provide insight into both the i-FCIQMC algorithm and the diatomics themselves.},

    abstract = {Benchmark quality adiabatic electron affinities for a collection of atoms and small molecules were obtained with the Feller-Peterson-Dixon composite coupled cluster theory method. Prior applications of this method demonstrated its ability to accurately predict atomization energies/heats of formation for more than 170 molecules. In the current work, the 1-particle expansion involved very large correlation consistent basis sets, ranging up to aug-cc-pV9Z (aug-cc-pV10Z for H and H2), with the goal of minimizing the residual basis set truncation error that must otherwise be approximated with extrapolation formulas. The n-particle expansion begins with coupled cluster calculations through iterative single and double excitations plus a quasiperturbative treatment of "connected" triple excitations (CCSD(T)) pushed to the complete basis set limit followed by CCSDT, CCSDTQ, or CCSDTQ5 corrections. Due to the small size of the systems examined here, it was possible in many cases to extend the n-particle expansion to the full configuration interaction wave function limit. Additional, smaller corrections associated with core/valence correlation, scalar relativity, anharmonic zero point vibrational energies, and non-adiabatic effects were also included. The overall root mean square (RMS) deviation was 0.005 eV (0.12 kcal/mol). This level of agreement was comparable to what was found with molecular heats of formation. A 95{\%} confidence level corresponds to roughly twice the RMS value or 0.01 eV. While the atomic electron affinities are known experimentally to high accuracy, the molecular values are less certain. This contributes to the difficulty of gauging the accuracy of the theoretical results. A limited number of electron affinities were determined with the explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12b method. After extending the VnZ-F12 orbital basis sets with additional diffuse functions, the F12b method was found to accurately reproduce the best F/F(-) value obtained with standard methods, but it underestimated the CH3/CH3 (-) value by 0.01 eV.},

    Hartree-Fock open shell reference determinant.
    A spin orbital based formulation, in which the cluster operator spans
    exactly the minimal first order interacting space, is presented, and
    computationally optimal working equations are given.
    In the limit of a large number of closed shell orbitals,
    the cost is identical to that of an optimum treatment of an equivalent closed
    shell problem, which is obtained as a special case of the formulation presented.
    The theory is applied to the calculation of a number of diatomic potential energ
    y functions, and
    compared with spin-unrestricted theory."

abstract = {In this critical compilation, all known to us experimental data on the spectrum of neutral carbon were methodically evaluated and supplemented by parametric calculations with Cowan's code. The sources of experimental data vary from laboratory to astrophysical objects and employ different instrumentation from classical grating and Fourier transform spectrometers to precise laser spectroscopy setups and various other modern techniques. This comprehensive evaluation provides accurate atomic data on energy levels and wavelengths (observed and Ritz) with their estimated uncertainties, as well as a uniform description of observed line intensities. In total, 412 energy levels were optimized with the help of selected 1221 best observed lines participating in 1365 transitions in the wavelength region 750 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} to 609.14 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m. In addition, 737 possibly observable transitions are predicted. Critically evaluated transition probabilities for 1616 lines are provided, of which 241 are new. With the accurate energy levels obtained, combined with additional observed data on high Rydberg states, the ionization limit was determined to be 90 820.348(9) cm{\^{}}(-1) or 11.2602880(11) eV in fair agreement with the previously recommended value, but more accurate.},

@article{Kramida2010,
abstract = {For more than 50years, Charlotte Moore's compilation of atomic energy levels and its subsequent revisions have been the standard source of reference data for the spectra of hydrogen and its isotopes. In those publications, theoretical data based on quantum-electrodynamic calculations have been given. This reflects the fact that the theory of the hydrogen spectrum has been perfected to an extent far exceeding the capabilities of the best measurements. However, rapid advances in the techniques of laser spectroscopy and optical frequency metrology have recently put experiments on a par with theory in terms of precision. This calls for construction of new comprehensive data sets for H, D, and T that summarize the latest experimental work and can be directly compared with the modern theoretical reference data. The present work compiles several tens of recent measurements of the hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium fine and hyperfine structure intervals and presents sets of energy levels and Ritz wavelengths derived from those measurements. Data exist for the fine structure of energy levels of hydrogen and deuterium up to principal quantum number n=12. For higher lying levels, there are many observed lines with unresolved fine structure. From those observations, level centers (centers of the fine structure) are derived by a least-squares optimization, and Ritz wavelengths of series with upper levels up to n=40 are obtained. For tritium, the n=2 and 3 energy level intervals are derived from experimental observations.},

@article{Powell2017,
abstract = {The association/dissociation reaction path for ozone (O2 + O ↔ O3) is notoriously difficult to describe accurately using ab initio electronic structure theory, due to the importance of both strong and dynamic electron correlations. Experimentally, spectroscopic studies of the highest lying recorded vibrational states combined with the observed negative temperature dependence of the kinetics of oxygen isotope exchange reactions confirm that the reaction is barrierless, consistent with the latest potential energy surfaces. Previously reported potentials based on Davidson-corrected internally contracted multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) suffer from a spurious reef feature in the entrance channel even when extrapolated towards the complete basis set limit. Here, we report an analysis of comparisons between a variety of electronic structure methods including internally contracted and uncontracted MRCI (with and without Davidson corrections), as well as full configuration interaction quantum Monte...},

abstract = {The formulation and implementation of the spin-free (SF) exact two-component (X2c) theory at the one-electron level (SFX2c-1e) is extended in the present work to the analytic evaluation of second derivatives of the energy. In the X2c-1e scheme, the four-component one-electron Dirac Hamiltonian is block diagonalized in its matrix representation and the resulting “electrons-only” two-component Hamiltonian is then used together with untransformed two-electron interactions. The derivatives of the two-component Hamiltonian can thus be obtained by means of simple manipulations of the parent four-component Hamiltonian integrals and derivative integrals. The SF version of X2c-1e can furthermore exploit available nonrelativistic quantum-chemical codes in a straightforward manner. As a first application of analytic SFX2c-1e second derivatives, we report a systematic study of the equilibrium geometry and vibrational frequencies for the bent ground state of the copper hydroxide (CuOH) molecule.

abstract = {The introduction of relativistic terms into the nonrelativistic all-electron Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation is achieved by the method of normalized elimination of the small component (ESC) within the matrix representation of the modified Dirac equation. In contrast to the usual method of ESC, the method presented retains the correct relativistic normalization, and permits the construction of a single matrix relating the large and small component coefficient matrices for an entire set of positive energy one-particle states, thus enabling the whole set to be obtained with a single diagonalization. This matrix is used to define a modified set of one- and two-electron integrals which have the same appearance as the nonrelativistic integrals, and to which they reduce in the limit $\alpha$→0. The normalized method corresponds to a projection of the Dirac–Fock matrix onto the positive energy states. Inclusion of the normalization reduces the discrepancy between the eigenvalues of the ESC approach and the Dirac eigenvalues for a ...},

@article{Handy1986,
abstract = {The prediction of the diagonal correction to the Born–Oppenheimer approximation is now possible by a b i n i t i o analytic methods, as has recently been shown by Yarkony and Lengsfield. At the general restricted Hartree–Fock (GRHF) level of approximation, the procedure is straightforward: solutions of the coupled perturbed Hartree–Fock equations (CPHF) and some overlap integrals are all that are required. This correction is evaluated for a series of small molecules with various basis sets: H2O, H2O+, CH2, HCF, H+ 5, and F2. It is interesting to observe that the value of this correction (0.11 kcal) for the singlet–triplet splitting of CH2 is larger than the relativistic correction, and that the theoretical value for T nr e (BO)≡9.23±0.20 kcal has come even closer to the best a b i n i t i o prediction of 9.4 kcal.},

@article{Kallay2001,
abstract = {The viability of treating higher excitations in coupled-cluster theory is discussed. An algorithm is presented for solving coupled-cluster (CC) equations which can handle any excitation. Our method combines the formalism of diagrammatic many-body perturbationtheory and string-based configuration interaction (CI). CC equations are explicitly put down in terms of antisymmetrized diagrams and a general method is proposed for the factorization of the corresponding algebraic expressions. Contractions between cluster amplitudes and intermediates are evaluated by a string-based algorithm. In contrast to our previous developments [J. Chem. Phys. 113, 1359 (2000)] the operation count of this new method scales roughly as the (2n+2) nd power of the basis set size where n is the highest excitation in the cluster operator. As a by-product we get a completely new CI formalism which is effective for solving both truncated and full CI problems. Generalization for approximate CC models as well as multireference cases is also discussed.},
