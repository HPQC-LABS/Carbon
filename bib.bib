@article{Cleland2010,
abstract = {We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers. Using the N 2 molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to compute the energy with cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets, the latter having an FCI space of over 10 15 with very modest computational resources.},

@article{Daday2012,
abstract = {We employ the recently developed full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method to compute the $\pi$ → $\pi$* vertical excitation energies of ethene and all-trans butadiene. These excitations have been the subject of extensive theoretical studies, and their location with respect to the corresponding absorption band maximum is the source of a long lingering debate. Here, we reliably estimate the vertical excitations of ethene and butadiene by performing FCIQMC calculations for spaces as large as 1018 and 1029 Slater determinants, respectively. For ethene, we obtain a vertical excitation energy in the range 7.89–7.96 eV, depending on the particular equilibrium ground-state geometry employed, and definitely higher than the absorption maximum located at 7.66 eV. For the computationally more challenging case of butadiene, our calculations provide a robust estimate of about 6.3 eV for this excitation, that is, 0.4 eV higher than the corresponding absorption band maximum. Our FCIQMC excitation energi...},

Our results for the Bethe logarithms lnk0(2 2S)=5.178 169 (4), and for mass polarization corrections $\Delta$lnk0(2 2S)=0.113 81 (3) are in disagreement with ones obtained recently in the literature. In contrast, results lnk0(2 2P)=5.179 81 (7) and $\Delta$lnk0(2 2P)=0.111 3 (5) are in good agreement with them. From our theoretical predictions and recent measurements of 6,7Li D lines at NIST, we determine the mean-square charge radius difference between 7Li and 6Li nuclei, in agreement with determinations based on the 3 2S1/2-2 2S1/2 transition, which demonstrates consistency of atomic spectroscopy determination of fundamental properties of nuclei.},

abstract = {We expand upon the recent semi-stochastic adaptation to full configuration interaction

quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC). We present an alternate method for generating the deterministic space without a priori knowledge of the wave function and present stochastic efficiencies for a variety of both molecular and lattice systems. The algorithmic details of an efficient semi-stochastic implementation are presented, with particular consideration given to the effect that the adaptation has on parallel performance in FCIQMC. We further demonstrate the benefit for calculation of reduced density matrices in FCIQMC through replica sampling, where the semi-stochastic adaptation seems to have even larger efficiency gains. We then combine these ideas to produce explicitly correlated corrected FCIQMC energies for the beryllium dimer, for which stochastic errors on the order of wavenumber accuracy are achievable.},

@article{Booth2009a,
abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods--a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O(2), CH(4), and NaH--with FCI spaces ranging from 10(9) to 10(14), whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

abstract = {The initiator full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (i-FCIQMC) method has recently been developed as a highly accurate stochastic electronic structure technique. It has been shown to calculate the exact basis-set ground state energy of small molecules, to within modest stochastic error bars, using tractable computational cost. Here, we use this technique to elucidate an often troublesome series of first-row diatomics consisting of Be2, C2, CN, CO, N2, NO, O2, and F2. Using i-FCIQMC, the dissociation energies of these molecules are obtained almost entirely to within chemical accuracy of experimental results. Furthermore, the i-FCIQMC calculations are performed in a relatively black-box manner, without any a priori knowledge or specification of the wave function. The size consistency of i-FCIQMC is also demonstrated with regards to these diatomics at their more multiconfigurational stretched geometries. The clear and simple i-FCIQMC wave functions obtained for these systems are then compared and investigated to demonstrate the dynamic identification of the dominant determinants contributing to significant static correlation. The appearance and nature of such determinants is shown to provide insight into both the i-FCIQMC algorithm and the diatomics themselves.},
