\begin{abstract}
We show that we can predict
the first ionization energy in carbon to within 1.076~cm$^{-1}$ of the experimental value. This is an improvement of more than a factor of 5 over the preceding best prediction in [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{81}, 022503] and comparable to the accuracies achieved for the smaller atoms up to boron. The sum of all error contributions in our calculations up to the fifth power of the fine structure constant is estimated to be at most 0.806~cm$^{-1}$, which yields our estimate of contributions in the sixth and higher powers to be: 1.076$~\pm~$0.806~cm$^{-1}$.

%\section{Introduction}

In the last seven years, ionization energies (IEs) have been calculated
with unprecedented precision for the Li atom \cite{Puchalski2010},
Be atom \cite{Puchalski2013b} and B atom \cite{Puchalski2015}. Tight
variational bounds for non-relativistic ground state energies assuming
a clamped, point-sized nucleus have reached 49 digits in units of
Hartree for He, 19 digits for Li, 12 digits for Be, and 11 digits for
B (see Table \ref{tab:variational bounds}). Calculated
IEs have been made in agreement with experiment to
within $10^{-3}$~cm$^{-1}$ for $^{7}$Li, $10^{-1}$~cm$^{-1}$
for $^{9}$Be and $1$~cm$^{-1}$ for $^{11}$B (see Table \ref{tab:excitationEnergies}). 

%Boron agreement was 0.12cm-1. Not quite good enough to say "within 0.1cm-1"

For the C atom, before this present study, no high-precision calculation had been reported to predict an IE to $\sim1$~cm$^{-1}$
agreement with experiment.

%Table \ref{tab:variational bounds} shows
%that the method used for the calculation has a crucial impact on the
%precision obtainable: the best variational bound on the non-relativistic,
%clamped, point-nucleus (NR,CPN), ground state energy of Li is believed
%to be 8 orders of magnitude more accurate than that of the Be atom,
%because analytic expressions for the multi-center integrals of Hylleraas
%wavefunctions are only known for up to 3e$^{-}$, and it would be
%very slow to calculate them numerically for 4e$^{-}$. For 4e$^{-}$
%and greater, ECGs (\textbf{e}xplicitly \textbf{c}orrelated \textbf{G}aussian
%wavefunction\textbf{s)} are used. ECGs mimic the theoretical shape
%of the wavefunction less accurately (e.g. they are rounded rather
%than cusp-like in the limit of vanishing electron-electron distance,
%and in the infinite electron-electron distance limit they decay as
%$\nicefrac{1}{r^{2}}$ rather than $\nicefrac{1}{r}$), so more parameters
%are needed than when using Hylleraas wavefunctions. However, the integrals
%of ECGs are known analytically, regardless of the number of electrons,
%which is why it has been possible to do very high-precision calculations
%on Be \cite{Puchalski2013b} and B \cite{Puchalski2015}. 

Table \ref{tab:variational bounds} demonstrates that with
twice as many variationally optimizable parameters, 1 fewer digit was obtained for the B atom than for the Be atom.
This suggests that it would be very difficult to variationally optimize a fully explicitly correlated wavefunction ansatz for atoms and molecules coming from most of the periodic table. The
best known variational bound for the NR,CPN ground state energy for
C was calculated in 2015 using fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC)
with the nodes of the electronic wavefunction fixed at the locations
of a CISD/cc-pV5Z wavefunction, and the statistical uncertainty
on the Monte Carlo was $\pm20$~$\mu E_{\textrm{Hartree}}$ \cite{FN-DMC}. However, the IE for C predicted by FN-DMC was in discrepancy with experiment by more than 40\,cm$^{-1}$. In this
paper, the approach we use to calculate the NR,CPN energy of the ground
state of C is FCIQMC (full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo)
in an aug-cc-pCV8Z basis set. Table \ref{tab:variational bounds} shows
that our NR,CPN energy is at least 76~$\mu E_{h}$ higher than the
variational upper bound obtained from FN-DMC; but since in our approach, imperfections in the description of the wavefunction for the neutral atom are almost the same as in the cation, the errors are almost completely eliminated when taking the energy difference, therefore bringing us to agreement with experiment that is comparable to what has been seen with the explicitly correlated approach for atoms as big as (but not exceeding) boron. 

After adding relativistic and quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections, and corrections to the clamped nucleus approximation,
we obtained an IE for the ground sate of C
which is within 1.076~cm$^{-1}$ disagreement with the best known experimental
estimate. While this is not as impressive as the
method of variationally optimizing parameters in an explicitly correlated
wavefunciton ansatz has proven to be for Li and Be, the disagreement
has the same order of magnitude as the latter approach for B (see
Table \ref{tab:excitationEnergies}). We finally note that the approach
used in this paper, of calculating FCIQMC on a basis set of non-explicitly
correlated orbitals has successfully treated systems with far more
electrons (transition metal atoms \cite{Thomas2015a}, diatomics \cite{Cleland2012},
larger molecules such as butadiene \cite{Daday2012}, and even solid
state systems \cite{Booth2012a}), so it is conceivable that the approach used in this paper may in the near future be able to determine (with
fair accuracy) the IEs which at present remain experimentally elusive or poorly known. These include arsenic (whose experimental IE has an uncertainty of $\pm2$\,\textrm{cm}$^{-1}$), Pm, Pa, Fm, Md, No, Sg, Bh and Hs (whose IEs are only known based on extrapolations of other experimental data and have uncertainties between $\pm$140\,cm$^{-1}$ and $\pm$4000\,cm$^{-1}$), Rf and Db (whose IEs are only known from theoretical calculations), and Mt, Ds, Rg, Cn, Nh, Fl, Mc, Lv, Ts, and Og (for which no IE is given in NIST's most recent databases).

Our calculations in this paper can be divided into five stages: (A)
We develop larger core-valence (CV) basis sets than previously available for
carbon, (B) we calculate the 1- and 2-electron integrals in these
basis sets, (C) we attempt to solve the NR,CPN Schroedinger equation
at the FCI level in finite basis sets, (D) we extrapolate the finite basis set results to estimate the energies at the \textbf{c}omplete \textbf{b}asis \textbf{s}et (CBS) limtis, and (E) we estimate the size of corrections due
to special relativity, QED,  and due to the atom having an unclamed nucleus.

\subsection{Optimization of `tight function' exponents for the aug-cc-pCV7Z and
aug-cc-pCV8Z basis sets.}

The largest basis sets known for C prior to this work were the (aug-cc-pV$X$Z,
$X=$7,8,9) sets used by Feller in 2016 \cite{Feller2016}. These basis sets
did not contain `tight' exponent functions for capturing the effects
of the correlation between the core $(1s^{2},2s^{2})$ electrons and
the valence electrons $(2p^{2}$). The largest known basis set for carbon prior
to this work including the CV (core-valence) correction was the aug-cc-pCV6Z \cite{Wilson1996} set. In this work we start by optimizing the `tight' exponents for
the CV correction to Feller's 2016 aug-cc-pV7Z and aug-cc-pV8Z basis
sets, yielding the first aug-cc-pCV7Z basis set for carbon, and the
first aug-cc-pCV8Z basis set known.

The final aug-cc-pCV$X$Z basis sets have $X$ new tight functions of $s$-type, $X-1$ of $p$-type, $X-2$ of $d$-type, and so forth, up to the final $i$-type function for $X=7$ and the final $k$-type function for $X=8$. The $j^\textrm{th}$ exponent corresponding to a function of type $L$ is named $\gamma_{X,L,j}$, and is assumed to follow an ``even-tempered'' model: $\gamma_{X,L,j}=\alpha_{X,L,j}\beta_{X,L,j}^{j-1}$.

In the non-linear optimization procedure to obtain $\alpha_{7,L,j}$ and $\beta_{7,L,j}$, the starting values were chosen to be the $\alpha_{6,L,j}$ and $\beta_{6,L,j}$ values that were already optimized in \cite{Wilson1996}. These were then treated as free parameters to minimize the difference between the frozen core and all-electron CISD energies of the carbon atom with all other exponent functions fixed. The $\tt{MOLPRO}$ program \cite{MOLPRO} was used to calculate the CISD energies, and the $\tt{L}$-$\tt{BFGS}$-$\tt{B}$ program of \cite{Zhu:1997:ALF:279232.279236} was used to optimize the free parameters. The $s$-type functions were added first, then once they were optimized they were held fixed while the $p$-type functions were added and optimized. Then both the $s$- and $p$-type functions were held fixed while the $d$-type functions were added, and so on up to the single $i$-type function. The procedure for $X=8$ was the same, except the procedure continued to $k$-type functions, and the starting values came from the newly optimized $X=7$ case rather than the $X=6$ case from \cite{Wilson1996}.

The tight exponents optimized in this work for aug-cc-pCV7Z and aug-cc-pCV8Z are presented in the Supplemental Material.

\subsection{Calculation of 1- and 2-electron integrals including $k$- and $l$-
functions}

%The calculation of the 1-and 2-electron integrals for the (aug)-cc-p(C)VXZ basis sets, that include up to k- and l- functions, 

The calculation of the 1- and 2-electron integrals for (aug)-cc-p(C)V$X$Z
basis sets with $X\ge7$ is not possible with most quantum chemistry
packages, since  very few software packages support $k$-
and $l$- functions, but for first row elements, $k$-functions appear in $X=7$ basis sets
and $l$-functions appear when $X=8$. To calculate these integrals, we have used a locally modified version of {\tt MOLCAS 8.0} \cite{MOLCAS} which supports larger basis sets. The 1- and 2-electron integrals for C and C$^+$ were evaluated in the basis of the optimized CASSCF(6,5) and CASSCF(5,5) orbitals respectively, with the five active orbitals being the 1$s$, 2$s$, 2$p_x$, 2$p_y$ and 2$p_z$ of the C atom/ion. This active space is the minimal active space including all electrons, that is able to provide balanced orbitals for the three degenerate states of the $^3P$ state of the C atom, or the $^2P$ state of the C$^+$ ion.

%The MO-integrals have been evaluated in the basis of the optimized CASSCF(6,5) and CASSCF(5,5) MO orbitals, with the five active orbitals being the 1s, 2s, 2px, 2py and 2pz of the C atom. This active space is the minimal active space able to provide balanced orbitals for the three degenerate states of the 3P state of C atom



%We have used ${\tt MOLCAS}$
%to write the 1- and 2-electron integrals after a CAS(6,5)SCF  for C and CAS(5,5)SCF for C$^+$. In both cases, the 6 orbitals included were $1s,2s,2p_x,2p_y,2p_z$. The commercial version of ${\tt MOLCAS}$ had a
%memory leak when printing the 56~GB file containing the 1- and 2-electron integrals for aug-cc-pCV8Z, so we needed to turn off the storage of density matrices which previously were calculated automatically in ${\tt MOLCAS}$. 

\subsection{Calculation of NR-CPN energies in finite basis sets without truncating the possible excitation levels (FCIQMC)}

Deterministic FCI calculations were possible for the 5e$^-$ system C$^{+}$ in aug-cc-pCV6Z with about 130$\,$GB of RAM to store the Davidson vectors, but were not possible for the 6e$^-$ neutral C atom in this basis set (which would require almost 9\,TB of RAM), nor for 5e$^-$ in the aug-cc-pCV7Z basis set (which would require almost 55\,TB of RAM).  

We therefore use FCIQMC for all NR-CPN calculations. The wavefunction of the relevant system is expanded as a sum
of all possible Slater determinants given the basis set (full configuration interaction),
and the coefficients are determined by the number of walkers standing
on each determinant after a Monte Carlo sampling using the NR-CPN
Hamiltonian. The method was introduced in \cite{Booth2009a}, and
we use the initiator method first described in \cite{Cleland2010},
and the semi-stochastic method as described in \cite{Blunt2015}.
The calculations are performed using the developer version of the software ${\tt NECI}$ \cite{NECI}. 

Within a given Hamiltonian (in this case the NR-CPN Hamiltonian) and
basis set, there are three sources of error in the FCIQMC energy calculations: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Trial wavefunction error ($\Delta E_{{\rm trial}}$), which approaches
zero in the limit where the number of determinants used in the trial
wavefunction approaches the number of determinants in the FCIQMC wavefunction; 
\item Initiator error ($\Delta E_{{\rm initiator}}$), which approaches
zero in the limit where the number of walkers $N_{{\rm walkers}}$
gets sufficiently large; and 
\item Stochastic error ($\Delta E_{{\rm stoch}}$), which for a given number
of walkers is estimated as the square root of the unbiased variance
among different estimates $E_{i}$ of the energy from their mean $\bar{E}$
after different numbers $N$ of Monte Carlo macro-iterations (determined using the Flyvbjerg-Petersen blocking analysis \cite{Flyvbjerg1989}) after the walkers
have reached equilibrium: $\Delta E_{{\rm stochastic}}\approx\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(E_{i}-\bar{E}\right)^{2}}{N-1}}=\mathcal{O}\left(\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$.
\end{enumerate}

Our goal was to obtain all energies to a precision of $\pm\epsilon$
where $\epsilon\le1\mu E_{{\rm Hartree}}\approx0.2$~cm$^{-1}$ (within
the basis sets used). To ensure that $\Delta E_{{\rm initiator}}$
can be neglected, we used a sufficiently large value of $N_{{\rm walkers}}$
for every energy calculation, so that the energy difference between
using $N_{{\rm walkers}}$ and $\frac{1}{2}N_{{\rm walkers}}$ was
smaller than 1 $\mu E_{\rm{Hartree}}$. Likewise, to ensure that $\Delta E_{{\rm trial}}$ can be neglected, we used a sufficiently large number of determinants in the trial wavefunction for every energy calculation, such that $\Delta E_{{\rm trial}}$ would also be smaller than 1 $\mu E_{\rm{Hartree}}$. We then ran every calculation for enough macro-iterations $N$ such that $\Delta E_{{\rm stoch}}$ was smaller than $\Delta E_{{\rm trial}}$ and $\Delta E_{{\rm initiator}}$.

\subsection{Extrapolations to the complete basis set limit}

%An excellent review of the state-of-the-art in extrapolation choices is given on Page 5 of \cite{Feller2016}. The e 

We use two different families of formulas to extrapolate the correlation energies (FCIQMC energies with the ROHF energies subtracted out) from $E_{X-1}$ and $E_{X}$ to $E_{\textrm{CBS}}$:

%\begin{align}
%E_{\textrm{corr,CBS}} & %=E_{\textrm{corr},X}-\frac{A}{X^{n}}~,\\
%E_{\textrm{corr,CBS}} & %=E_{\textrm{corr},X}-\frac{A}{\left(X+\nice%frac{1}{2}\right)^n}~.
%\end{align}

\begin{align}
\label{Kutzelnigg}E_{\textrm{CBS}} & =E_{X}-\frac{A}{X^{n}}~,\\
E_{\textrm{CBS}} & =E_{X}-\frac{A}{\left(X+\nicefrac{1}{2}\right)^n}~.\label{Martin}
\end{align}

\noindent If we set $n=3$ in Eq.\,\eqref{Kutzelnigg}, we recover the formula originally proposed in \cite{Kutzelnigg1992}. If we set $n=4$ in Eq.\,\eqref{Martin}, we recover the formula originally proposed in \cite{Martin1996}.  If we have values for $E_{X}$ at two different $X$ values, we can eliminate $A$ in both cases, so Eq.\eqref{Kutzelnigg} leads to Eq.\eqref{KutzelniggSolved} and Eq.\eqref{Martin} leads to Eq.\eqref{MartinSolved}:

\begin{align}
\label{KutzelniggSolved}E_{\textrm{CBS}} & =\frac{X^nE_{X}-\left(X-1\right)^nE_{X-1}}{X^n-\left(X-1\right)^n}~,\\
\label{MartinSolved}E_{\textrm{CBS}} & =E_{X}+\frac{\left(2X-1\right)^n\left(E_X-E_{X-1}\right)}{\left(1+2X\right)^n-\left(2X-1\right)^n}~.
\end{align}

The values of $E_{\textrm{CBS}}$ obtained from using $n=3$ in Eq.\,\eqref{KutzelniggSolved} and $n=4$ in Eq.\ref{MartinSolved}, for $X=8$ were added to the ROHF energies for $X=8$ and are presented in Table \ref{tab:summary}. As explained on page 5 of \cite{Feller2016}, using $n=3$ in Eq.\eqref{Kutzelnigg} tends to over-estimate the extrapolation (as we also observe in this present work, see Table \ref{tab:summary}). The value of $n=3.5$ was therefore used in \cite{Feller2016}, and we have added a row in Table \ref{tab:summary} corresponding to this value. The final NR-CPN energy was taken as the mean of both values obtained from extrapolating the correlation energy and adding it to the ROHF energy with $X=8$, and the uncertainty in this mean was estimated as the square root of the unbiased variance of the two values.

\subsection{Estimation of relativistic, QED, and finite nuclear mass corrections corrections}

Scalar relativistic corrections were calculated by comparing the energies using the spin-free version of the 1e$^-$ X2C (exact 2-component) Hamiltonian, to the energies of the NR-CPN Hamiltonian. The spin-free 1e$^-$ version of the X2C Hamiltonian is equivalent to infinite-order DKH. The integrals of our X2C Hamiltonian with ROHF orbitals were done in the $\tt{CFOUR}$ program, and were calculated at various levels of coupled cluster theory with the $\tt{MRCC}$ program \cite{MRCC}.

Further scalar relativistic effects were included by adding the Breit and QED corrections
(including the vacuum polarization and the self-energy terms that
together comprise the Lamb shift) from the  state-averaged Dirac-Fock calculations done in \cite{Klopper2010}. The overall contribution from the Breit and QED correctons to the IE for C was -0.48\,cm$^{-1}$.

Diagonal Born-Oppenheimer breakdown corrections (DBOC) to the clamped nucleus approximation were calculated using $\tt{CFOUR}$, with $\tt{MRCC}$ used for the coupled-cluster part. Our value of -0.50\,cm$^{-1}$ is more than double the value of -0.08\,cm$^{-1}$ estimated in \cite{Klopper2010}, due to including higher levels of correlation.

The basis set and correlation convergence of the X2C and DBOC corrections is shown in Table \ref{tab:x2cAndDBOC}

\section{Conclusion}

Table \ref{tab:summary} summarizes the various contributions to our value of the IE, and compares our final value to experiment and to three recent theoretical estimates. Our value is 0.01\,cm$^{-1}$ larger than the best experimental value, but the spread of ionization energies we get using the two different extrapolation formulas is almost two orders of magnitude larger than this, so calculations with an aug-cc-pCV9Z basis set might be necessary to confirm this seemingly marvelous agreement. 

The best theoretical estimate of the IE before this work was in \cite{Klopper2010}, which we believe to be mainly due to the approximations inherent to the F12 approach used for their NR-CPN energy, and the perturbative nature of their scalar relativistic corrections (the mass velocity and Darwin terms, rather than the X2C calculation used in the present work) and due to calculating the DBOC correction at CCSD level (as opposed to CCSDTQ).
