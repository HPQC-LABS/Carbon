In the caption to Table III we said that details about the spin-orbit lowering value would be presented in the Supplemental Material:

C atom weighted average                     = (0.00*1 + 16.4167130*3 + 43.4134567 *5) / 9 =  29.5908247222 cm-1.
C(+) cation weighted average                = (0.00*2 + 63.395*4) / 6                     =  42.263333 cm-1
The effect on the IP is:     E(C(+)) - E(C) = 42.263333 + 29.5908247222                   = -12.672508 cm-1
